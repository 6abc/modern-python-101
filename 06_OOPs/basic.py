"""
Class:
------
`Class` are just like a building blueprint, they provide you with the
specifications of how to construct a building. It is upto you when and
how you build the building.

Instance:
---------
When you actually construct a building out of the blueprint, it is called as
an `Instance` or `Object` of the class. So, both are related but essential
different terminology.

Class = Blueprint, Instance = Building

Methods:
--------
These are just normal functions, but defined to alter the behaviour of your instance or class.
Since they are tied to a class, they are called as methods. Their behaviour is dependent on
the structure you define in the class.

When to use Class:
------------------
Use classes only when you need `Structure` and `Behaviour` together.

If you only need strcuture, then choose from any existing data structures such as
list, tuple, dictionary, queue, etc. Just need a behaviour? Then just create a function
that transforms your data.
